This is a simple python program, i know this is commonly used for assignments in the start of python and even C++classes
I would hope that you dont use this exact answer but definitely reference it if you are struggling with OOP in python or doing the hangman itself.
It is possible to do without OOP but my girlfriend spent a few days on it and it looked way more complicated to me. 
This was written in Python3 so use python3 Hangman.py to run.
